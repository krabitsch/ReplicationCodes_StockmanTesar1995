The repository contains replication codes of the workhorse two country two goods (tradable, non-tradable) international macro model of 

Stockman and Tesar (1995), American Economic Review: "Tastes and Technology in a Two-Country Model of the Business Cycle: Explaining International Comovements".

The codes are written in Matlab and make use of the toolbox of Schmidt-Groh√© and Uribe (https://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/2nd_order.htm)

folder "ST95 social planner": codes up the system of equilibrium conditions as obtained from the social planner problem (as done in the original paper)

folder "ST95 decentralized economy": codes up the system of equilibrium conditions as obtained from the decentralized economy instead

folder "ST95 documentation": provides an extensive step-by-step derivation of the model
